### 1.1 Note on Submodules

I do not recommend using this repository as a submodule, as it will not be updated with that use case in mind.

## 2. Folder structure and files

Here's a brief overview of the folder structure and key files in this repository:

- ðŸ“‚ `R`: This folder should contain all `.R` files that define the functions used in the `{targets}` pipeline.
- ðŸ“‚ `data`: Store raw and processed data files here.
- ðŸ“‚ `ms`: Contains the manuscript files, typically in Quarto `.qmd` format.
- ðŸ“‚ `output`: This is where the results, such as figures and tables, will be saved.
- ðŸ“‚ `bib`: This is where the `.bib` reference file should be stored, along with the `.csl` citation style, and any template files. Currently a template `.docx` file is included, as is `the-american-naturalist.csl`.

## 3. How to use this template

This repository is designed to be used as a template for a reproducible workflow and manuscript. It has been created to suit my use case, but released as others may also find it helpful.

Once downloaded, install and initialise the `{targets}` package:

```r
install.packages("targets")
targets::use_targets()
```
Then, you can start the pipeline with:

```r
tar_make()
```

This will execute the pipeline and produce the results in the `output` folder.

## 4. Customizing the template

Feel free to customize the template to better fit your specific needs. You can modify the folder structure, add new functions, or change the manuscript format as required.
